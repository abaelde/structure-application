# Python Style Rules

## Language
All code must be written in English: variable names, function names, comments, documentation, error messages, etc. Only user interactions (in conversations) can be in French.

## Docstrings
Do not add docstrings to Python functions. The code must be clear and explicit enough without extensive documentation.

## Data Manipulation
Always use pandas for data manipulation (CSV reading, transformation, aggregation, etc.).
