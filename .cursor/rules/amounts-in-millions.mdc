description: Rule for implementing amounts in millions in data

# Amounts in Millions Rule

## Principle
All amounts must be implemented in **millions** in input data and bordereaux.

## Application
- **In CSV bordereaux**: Amounts must be entered directly in millions (e.g.: 2 for 2 million)
- **In input parameters**: Program creation amounts must be in millions
- **In configuration files**: All amounts must be expressed in millions

## Examples
- ✅ Correct: `2` (to represent 2 million)
- ❌ Incorrect: `2000000` (to represent 2 million)

## Important
This rule applies **only to input data and bordereaux**. It must **NOT** be applied to the internal calculation logic of the system, which can continue to work with appropriate units according to calculation needs.

## Affected Files
- [examples/bordereaux/](mdc:examples/bordereaux/) - All CSV bordereau files
- [examples/program_creation/](mdc:examples/program_creation/) - Program creation scripts
- [program_config.xlsx](mdc:program_config.xlsx) - Program configuration
