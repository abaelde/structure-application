# UV Dependency Management

This repository uses **UV** for all dependency management and script execution.

## Key Points:
- Use `uv` commands instead of `pip`, `pipenv`, or `poetry`
- Dependencies are managed through [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) and [uv.lock](mdc:uv.lock)
- To install dependencies: `uv sync`
- To run scripts: `uv run <script_name>`
- To add new dependencies: `uv add <package_name>`
- To run Python files: `uv run python <file.py>`

Always prefer UV over other Python package managers when working with this codebase.
